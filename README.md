Syndra
=========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/csvoss/syndra.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/csvoss/syndra)

Syndra is an **inference engine** for rule-based biological models.

It supports making inferences over sets of modeling rules, which allows
**redundancies** to be detected and eliminated from those rules. For example, if
we have the rules `MEK phosphorylates MAPK` and `MAPK, when phosphorylated, is
active`, Syndra can confirm that these rules imply `MEK activates MAPK`.

Syndra can also detect when a set of rules are **mutually incompatible**. For
example, Syndra can detect that no model is compatible with the two rules `A,
when phosphorylated, is active` and `A, when phosphorylated, is inactive` both
at once.

Finally, it supports **inferring gaps** in sets of model rules. Given a set of
facts which, when combined, are enough to deduce a single model, but which might
not necessarily be rules themselves, Syndra can deduce the satisfying model.

This system works by translating each rule into predicates in the ***iota***
language, a logic designed by Adrien Husson and Jean Krivine to describe
predicates over rule-based biological models. Our inferences about these
predicates are then powered by the [**z3 theorem
prover**](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).

Simple usage example
---

The following example demonstrates how to create a Syndra predicate, check its
satisfiability, and get a model.

Predicates are constructed by combining together subclasses of Predicate
(`engine/predicate.py`) and subclasses of Structure (`engine/structure.py`). For
example, the following predicate asserts that the model must have one rule in
which a binds to b on the left hand side, and one rule in which a does not bind
to b on the right hand side; these rules are allowed to be the same rule or
different rules.

```python
import predicate
import structure
a = structure.Agent("a")
b = structure.Agent("b")
p = predicate.And(predicate.ModelHasRule(lambda r:
                        predicate.PregraphHas(r, a.bound(b))),
                  predicate.ModelHasRule(lambda r:
                        predicate.PostgraphHas(r, a.unbound(b))))
```

Having constructed a Syndra predicate in this way, it and other predicates can be added to a Syndra *solver*. The Syndra solver supports an API similar to Z3's solver. Once predicates have been added to a solver, we can *check for satisfiability* of the solver's predicates (`.check()`), and we can get the *model* satisfying those predicates (`.model()`).

```python
import solver
s = solver.MySolver("a", "b")
s.add(p)
s.check()
s.model()
```



Constructing predicates
---------

Here are three different ways to construct a predicate in Syndra; once a
predicate has been constructed, it can be used to make inferences.


### 1: From Syndra macros

Syndra provides a number of *macros*, ways to easily construct Syndra predicates
describing common biological rules. See `macros.py` for these.

```python
>>> from engine import macros
>>> p1 = macros.directly_phosphorylates("A", "B")
>>> p2 = macros.phosphorylated_is_active("B")
>>> p3 = macros.directly_activates("A", "B")
>>> from engine import predicate
>>> s = solver.MySolver("A", "B")
>>> s.check(predicate.Implies(predicate.And(p1, p2), p3))
True
```

### 2: Writing an *iota* predicate directly

It is also possible to construct your own macros by writing *iota* predicates
using Syndra. Consult `engine/predicate.py` and `engine/structure.py` for a list
of building blocks (subclasses of `Predicate` and `Structure`) that can be used
to construct predicates. See the tests for examples of how to build up these
predicates.

**Predicate**

`Predicate`: the abstract superclass of every predicate

`Top`: a simple always-true predicate

`Bottom`: a simple always-false predicate

`And`: combine two predicates using logical **and**

`Or`: combine two predicates using logical **or**

`Not`: apply logical **not**

`Implies`: combine two predicates `x`, `y` into `x => y`

`ModelHasRule`: assert that the model has a rule `r` (instantiated within a lambda function passed in to `ModelHasRule`) such that `r` has certain properties (determined by a Syndra predicate returned by the body of the lambda function)

`ForAllRules`: like `ModelHasRule`, but asserts that all rules obey the properties

`PregraphHas`: assert that a particular rule `r` (which must be instantiated using `ModelHasRule` or `ForAllRules`) has a certain `Structure` within the left-hand side (pregraph) of the rule

`PostgraphHas`: [...] within the right-hand side (postgraph) of the rule


**Structure**

`Structure`: the abstract superclass of every structure

`Agent`: the most basic structure, representing a node in the graph

To create more complicated structures, combine Agents using the built-in methods of Structure, such as `bound`, `with_site`, and `labeled`.

Note: In any phrase such as `a.bound(b)`, the node `a` is *"central";* this means that if you add another `.bound` call to make `(a.bound(b)).bound(c)`, the result is treated as a graph with a link between`a` and `b` and a link between `a` and `c`.

### 3: From INDRA

[**INDRA**](https://github.com/sorgerlab/indra) is a system that can gather
statements (rules) for rule-based modeling from natural language and from
databases; these statements are represented by INDRA as Python objects. Syndra
predicates can be automatically generated from a subset of INDRA statements.
This functionality is provided by `interface_indra_to_syndra.py`.

Here I'll show how to use Syndra with INDRA in order to prove that `MEK
phosphorylates MAPK at Thr183`, `MEK phosphorylates MAPK at Tyr185`, and `MAPK,
when phosphorylated at Thr183 and Tyr185, is active` all together imply `MEK
activates MAPK`.

Suppose we have the following INDRA statements corresponding, in order, to these
rules:

```python
>>> s1
Phosphorylation(MAP2K1, MAPK1, PhosphorylationThreonine, 183)
>>> s2
Phosphorylation(MAP2K1, MAPK1, PhosphorylationTyrosine, 185)
>>> s3
ActivityModification(MAPK1, ['PhosphorylationThreonine', 'PhosphorylationTyrosine'],
    ['183', '185'], increases, Activity)
>>> s4
ActivityActivity(MAP2K1, Kinase, increases, MAPK1, Kinase)
```

We want to show that `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` all together imply `s4`. We can
generate a Syndra predicate that combines the first three together:

```python
>>> from interface_indra_to_syndra import syndra_from_statements
>>> pred = syndra_from_statements(s1, s2, s3)
```

Then, we can check that these statements are mutually consistent. The solver
(see `solver.py`) provides a way to manipulate predicates in order to check
their satisfiability.

```python
>>> s = solver.MySolver()
>>> s.add(pred)
>>> s.check()   ## Consistency check
True
```


Manipulating predicates
---

### Creating a solver

Note that a solver must be instantiated with a list of agents.

```
>>> s = solver.MySolver("MEK", "ERK", "SAF1")
```

### Check satisfiability

If a predicate is satisfiable, that means that there is at least one way to
build a model that satisfies that predicate. You can check whether this is true
for any given Syndra predicate using `.check()`.

```python
>>> s = solver.MySolver()
>>> satisfiable = predicate.Top()
>>> s.add(satisfiable)
>>> s.check()
True
>>> unsatisfiable = predicate.Bottom()
>>> s.add(unsatisfiable)
>>> s.check()
False
```

### Get model

For a satisfiable predicate, you can also extract a specific example of a model
that adheres to that predicate using `.model()`.

```python
>>> s = solver.MySolver()
>>> s.add(predicate)
>>> s.model()
```

The models that are returned by this come as Python objects made out of the classes `RuleResult`, `GraphResult`, and `NodeResult`. To get a raw z3 model instead, use `._model_z3()`.


Installation instructions
---

You will need to first install Z3. Follow the Z3 installation instructions at
[Z3Prover/z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3), being sure to install the Python
bindings:

```
git clone https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3
cd z3
python scripts/mk_make.py --python
cd build
make
make install
```

Then, install Syndra itself. To install this code locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/csvoss/syndra/
cd syndra
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need to install INDRA dependencies if you are planning to test Syndra
on INDRA statements; consult the instructions
[here](https://github.com/sorgerlab/indra).


Future directions
---
* Improve the functionality in `solver.py` for converting Z3 models to Python models; perhaps at least print them out in some more Kappa-esque fashion
* Include a library over Syndra for refinements on labels
* Re-integrate the latest engine with INDRA, by fixing `interface_indra_to_syndra.py` and migrating `old/engine/statements_to_predicates.py` to the new `engine/`

See [Issues](https://github.com/csvoss/syndra/issues) for more.
